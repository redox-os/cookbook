# Version date: 02-August-2024
#
# Notes:
# As Tyrian is an ancient, sprite based game, the code isn't updated
# super frequently. So instead of just pinning the version to the last
# official release in 2022, I'm pulling from main because it's unlikely
# anything will break. The last two commits were small fixes, one in 2023
# and one in 2024.
