#TODO waiting for openat implementation, building without openat fails
#NOTE although project supports building without openat, but the corresponding #if check
# checks for the presence of st_mtime, and if it exists it falsely assumes that AT_FDCWD is supported too
# for more info see starting from programs/util.c line 262: #if (PLATFORM_POSIX_VERSION >= 200809L) && defined(st_mtime)
