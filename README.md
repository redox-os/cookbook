# Cookbook

Package system of Redox.

This repository contains the system source code and packages inside the `recipes` folder.

- A recipe can be a software port or system package (they use `pkgar` or `tar.gz` formats).

**Read [this](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/porting-applications.html) page before porting programs to Redox**

In order for this repository to be useful, it must be set up with an environment
from the [redox](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/redox) repository or inside Redox OS with `cookbook` package.

### Cookbook Config

Cookbook has special config to avoid repetitive args, place this file into `cookbook.toml` (in this cookbook directory, not redox build system) and configure it necessarily.

```toml
# Configuration file
# This is a configuration file to avoid repetitively spelling command args.
# At the moment only mirrors here implemented but in future it will be expanded when scripts are rusted

[mirrors]
# see list of GNU FTP mirrors at https://www.gnu.org/prep/ftp.en.html
"ftp.gnu.org/gnu" = "example.com/gnu"
"github.com/foo/bar" = "github.com/baz/bar" 
```

### Recipe Categories

The categories inside the `recipes` folder.

- `core` - System components
- `demos` - Programs with demos and examples
- `dev` - Programs used for development and programming languages, like compilers and dependency managers
- `doc` - Programs used for documentation
- `emulators` - Console emulators or compatibility layers
- `fonts` - Fonts and programs for fonts
- `games` - Any kind of game
- `graphics` - Programs used for graphics processing or production
- `gui` - Orbital
- `icons` - Icon packs
- `libs` - Software with functions for other softwares, like OpenSSL
- `math` - Programs used for calculations
- `net` - Networking tools
- `other` - Software that can't fit on other categories
- `shells` - Terminal interpreters and extensions
- `sound` - Software used for sound processing or production
- `tests` - Software used to test other softwares
- `tools` - Text editors, terminal tools and any other kind of tools
- `tui` - Programs with a [terminal user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)
- `video` - Programs used for video playback, processing and production
- `web` - World Wide Web browsers and tools
- `wip` - Software that needs porting or incomplete recipes

### Search Recipes

Click in the button named "Find file" on the top of this repository to search for recipe names.

### Package Policy

Before sending your recipe to upstream (to become a public package), you must follow these rules:

#### Naming

- The recipe name can't have dots, backslashes, and NULs

#### Cross-Compilation

- All recipes must use our cross-compilers, a Cookbook [template](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/porting-applications.html#templates) does this automatically but it's not always possible, study the build system of your program or library to find these options or patch the configuration files.
- Don't hardcode the CPU architecture on the recipe script (this would break the multi-arch support).

#### Tarballs

- Don't use the auto-generated tarballs from GitHub, they aren't static and don't verify the archive integrity.

#### ABI stability

- Respect the ABI separation of the libraries, for example, if `openssl1` is available and some program need `openssl3`, you will create a recipe for `openssl3` and not rename the `openssl1`, as it will break the dependent packages.

#### Checksum

- If your recipe download a tarball, you will need to create a BLAKE3 hash for it. You can learn how to do it [here](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/porting-applications.html#create-a-blake3-hash-for-your-recipe).

#### License

- Don't package programs or libraries lacking a license.
- Verify if the program has some license violation, in case of doubt ask us on the [chat](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/chat.html).
- Non-free programs and assets should go to a subcategory of the `nonfree` category and be approved per license.

### Testing Area

Work-in-progress software ports goes to the `wip` category, be aware of these items during your packaging process:

- A recipe is considered ready if it's mostly working inside of Redox.
- All WIP recipes must have a `#TODO` on the beginning of the `recipe.toml` and explain what is missing.
- BLAKE3 hashes for tarballs are optional (quick testing workflow)
- Try to keep the recipe with the latest stable version of the program (the porting process can take months).
- Once the recipe is ready, add the BLAKE3 hash if needed and move the folder to the appropriate category.

#### Suggestions for TODOs

These TODOs improve the packagers cooperation and understanding.

- `not compiled or tested` - It means that your recipe is fully configured and don't lack necessary dependencies.
- `missing script for x, see insert-the-link-for-build-instructions-here` - It means that your recipe is lacking the cross-compilation script for some build system, where `x` is the build system name. After `see` you will insert the link for the build instructions of the program or library, it will help other packagers to insert the script for you.
- `missing dependencies, see insert-the-link-for-required-dependencies-here` - It means that the `dependencies = []` section is incomplete.
- `probably wrong script, see insert-the-link-for-build-instructions-here` - It means that you don't know if your script will work.
- `probably wrong template, see insert-the-link-for-build-instructions-here` - It means that you don't know if the Cookbook template will work.
- `probably missing dependencies, see insert-the-link-for-required-dependencies-here` - It means that you don't know if the required dependencies are satisfied.
- `promote` - It means that the recipe is working and should be moved to the equivalent category at `cookbook/recipes`

Other TODOs are specific and won't be covered on this list.

### Repository Layout

- `.cargo` - Cargo configuration.
- `bin` - LLVM and pkg-config CPU targets.
- `recipes` - Package configuration files.
- `src` - Package system source code.

### TODO

- Convert old recipes to TOML, see [this](https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/cookbook/-/issues/174) tracking issue.
- Remove the scripts after full TOML conversion.
